# Introduction
This project focuses on predicting departure delays of 15 minutes or more (`DEP_DEL15`) for flights leaving Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT). We use data from 2022 and 2023, along with pre-departure information, to train models that estimate the likelihood of delay. The final predictions are submitted for a held-out 2024 test set. We implement and compare a baseline logistic regression model and a more powerful XGBoost classifier.

# Data Exploration

## Data Overview

fl23 <- read_csv("flights2023.csv")
fl <- bind_rows(
  fl22 %>% mutate(dataset = "2022"),
  fl23 %>% mutate(dataset = "2023")
)
```

```


We worked with flight datasets from 2022 and 2023, containing commercial airline activity to and from Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT). After loading the datasets, we combined them and identified a total of 137,425 flights with 65 features per flight record. These features include scheduled and actual times, delays, airport information, carrier identifiers, and operational statistics.

A breakdown of variable types revealed 49 numeric and 16 character fields. Key variables such as `FL_DATE`, `DEP_DEL15`, `CRS_DEP_TIME`, and `OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER` provided the basis for modeling flight delays. We focused exclusively on departing flights (`ORIGIN == "PIT"`), aligning with the project objective of predicting departure delays based only on information available prior to takeoff.

The data had a low missingness rate overall for departure-related variables, though fields associated with delay reasons (`CARRIER_DELAY`, `WEATHER_DELAY`, etc.) had high missingness (~82%). This is expected because these variables are not available at prediction time. The target variable DEP_DEL15 had about 2% missingness, which we accounted for during model training by removing or imputing missing instances.

## Missingness and Class Imbalance
```{r, include = FALSE}
missings <- fl %>%
  miss_var_summary() %>%
  arrange(desc(n_miss))

fl %>%
  count(dataset, DEP_DEL15) %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n))
```


```{r}
fl <- fl %>%
  mutate(DEP_DEL15 = as.integer(DEP_DEL15))

# Check balance of the target variable
fl_departures %>%
  mutate(DEP_DEL15 = as.factor(DEP_DEL15)) %>%
  count(dataset, DEP_DEL15) %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  mutate(percent = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = DEP_DEL15, y = percent, fill = dataset)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Delayed Flights by Year", x = "Departure Delay 15+ Minutes", y = "Proportion") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  theme_minimal()
```

We assessed the missingness in the combined dataset and found that most core variables were well-populated, with over 97% completion. However, several post-departure variables were highly incomplete, such as `FIRST_DEP_TIME`, `TOTAL_ADD_GTIME`, and `LONGEST_ADD_GTIME`, each missing in over 99% of records. These fields, along with `CARRIER_DELAY`, `WEATHER_DELAY`, and `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY` (each ~82% missing), represent information not available before departure, and were therefore excluded from feature consideration.

The response variable `DEP_DEL15` had a relatively low missing rate of ~2.5%. We visualized class balance across the two years (see Figure 1), finding that the proportion of delayed flights (15+ minutes) remained fairly stable: about 19% in 2022 and 17% in 2023. The majority class (`DEP_DEL15 = 0`) represented over 80% of flights in both years, indicating a moderate class imbalance. Although not severe, this imbalance is worth addressing during model evaluation to avoid overly optimistic performance on the majority class.

## Initial Trends and Patterns
```{r}
# Add temporal features
fl <- fl %>%
  mutate(
    flight_date = as.Date(FL_DATE),
    month       = factor(month(flight_date, label = TRUE), ordered = TRUE),
    weekday     = factor(wday(flight_date, label = TRUE), ordered = TRUE)
  )


# Plot delay rate by weekday
fl %>%
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  summarise(delay_rate = mean(DEP_DEL15, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=weekday, y=delay_rate)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
    labs(title="Delay Rate by by Day of Week",x = "Day of Week", y="P(Delay ≥15min)")+
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# Plot delay rate by scheduled departure hour
fl %>%
  group_by(DEP_TIME_BLK) %>%
  summarise(delay_rate = mean(DEP_DEL15, na.rm=TRUE), n=n()) %>%
  filter(n > 100) %>%              # drop tiny bins
  ggplot(aes(x=DEP_TIME_BLK, y=delay_rate)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1)) +
    labs(title="Delay Rate by Scheduled Departure Time Block", y="P(Delay ≥15min)") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) 
```

```{r}
# Plot delay rate by carrier
fl_departures %>%
  group_by(OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER) %>%
  summarize(delay_rate = mean(DEP_DEL15 == 1, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>%
  filter(n > 50) %>%  # Only show carriers with enough flights
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER, delay_rate), y = delay_rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Delay Rate by Carrier", x = "Carrier", y = "Delay Rate") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  theme_minimal()
```


```{r}
fl %>%
  filter(!is.na(DEP_DELAY)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(DISTANCE_GROUP), y=DEP_DELAY)) +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA) +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(x="Distance Group", y="Departure Delay (min)",
         title="DEP_DELAY Distribution by Distance Group")
```


We explored how delay patterns vary across time and operational characteristics. As shown in Figure 2, flights scheduled on Tuesdays experienced the highest delay rates (~21%), while Wednesdays and Sundays had the lowest (~17%). This suggests that operational congestion or scheduling inefficiencies may be more pronounced midweek.

A more pronounced trend emerged when analyzing delay rates by scheduled departure time blocks (`DEP_TIME_BLK`). As shown in Figure 3, morning flights (before 9 AM) exhibited relatively low delay rates (under 10%), while evening flights (after 6 PM) saw rates exceed 30%. This pattern aligns with the well-documented “cascading delay” effect, where early delays propagate through the day and impact later departures.

Carrier behavior also played a role. Figure 4 reveals significant variation in delay rates by airline. For example, Frontier (F9) and Spirit (NK) exhibited the highest delay rates, while Delta (DL) and United (UA) performed relatively better. These differences could reflect varying operational efficiency, buffer time strategies, or hub congestion.

We further examined two continuous relationships. As shown in Figure 5, the distribution of `DEP_DELAY` by `DISTANCE_GROUP` was relatively stable, though long-distance flights had slightly wider delay spreads. Lastly, Figure 6 visualizes a weak but noticeable positive trend between taxi-out time and departure delay, hinting at congestion on the tarmac or delays in gate departure. While taxi-out time is not available pre-flight, patterns from similar flights could inform feature engineering.

These exploratory insights guided our feature engineering, motivating the creation of time-of-day flags, day-of-week indicators, carrier-level delay profiles, and route-level congestion estimates.

##  Feature Engineering Motivation
Based on the observed delay patterns, we engineered several features to better capture temporal, operational, and carrier-specific influences on departure delays.

### Temporal Features
Given the significant variation in delay rates by time of day (Figure 3), we created a set of categorical indicators based on scheduled departure time (`CRS_DEP_TIME` and `DEP_TIME_BLK`). This included:

A morning flight flag (departures before 9 AM),

An evening flight flag (departures after 6 PM), and

A peak hour flag (departures between 3 PM and 7 PM), where cascading delays were most pronounced.

We also created a day-of-week categorical variable to capture patterns seen in Figure 2, as certain days like Tuesday and Friday had elevated delay risks.

### Carrier Features
From Figure 4, we observed that delay rates differ markedly by airline. We encoded the carrier (`OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER`) as a categorical variable and also computed:

A carrier-specific historical delay rate, calculated as the average DEP_DEL15 for each carrier across the training data. This allowed us to capture latent operational quality beyond what is represented by the categorical code alone.

### Route and Distance Features
We grouped flights by `ORIGIN-DEST` pairs and computed:

Route-level delay rates, based on historical averages,

Flight distance bins using `DISTANCE_GROUP` as a proxy for short-haul vs long-haul performance.

While `DISTANCE itself` was included as a numerical feature, the grouped delay distribution by distance in Figure 5 suggested additional insights might come from interaction terms.

### Congestion Proxies
While we could not directly use `TAXI_OUT` time (unavailable pre-departure), we computed average taxi-out times by origin airport and time block from historical data. These were used as surrogate features for tarmac congestion, inspired by the trend in Figure 6.

Other Features.
We also created:

Weekend indicator (Saturday or Sunday),

Holiday proximity flag (within ±2 days of major holidays),

Flight count per hour to estimate airport congestion per time block.

All engineered features were joined to the flight-level data and tested iteratively during model selection. Feature importance results (shown in Section 3) confirmed that many of these engineered variables improved model performance beyond raw variables alone.

# 3. Supervised Modeling
To predict whether a flight departing from Pittsburgh would be delayed by 15 minutes or more, we implemented both linear and non-linear classification models. We began with logistic regression as a baseline, then progressed to gradient boosting (XGBoost) for improved predictive accuracy.

## 3.1 Logistic Regression

```{r}
library(pROC)

feats <- fl %>%
  filter(!is.na(DEP_DEL15)) %>%
  transmute(
    DEP_DEL15,
    TAIL_NUM,
    flight_date = as.Date(FL_DATE, format = "%m/%d/%Y"),
    wd = factor(wday(flight_date, label = TRUE), ordered = TRUE),
    hr = CRS_DEP_TIME %/% 100,
    log_dist = log(DISTANCE),
    taxi_out = TAXI_OUT,
    carrier = OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER
  )

set.seed(42)
train_ix <- sample(nrow(feats), size = 0.7 * nrow(feats))
train <- feats[train_ix, ]
valid <- feats[-train_ix, ]

enc <- train %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(carrier_rate = mean(DEP_DEL15), .groups = "drop")
base_rate <- mean(train$DEP_DEL15)

train <- left_join(train, enc, by = "carrier")
valid <- left_join(valid, enc, by = "carrier") %>%
  mutate(carrier_rate = replace_na(carrier_rate, base_rate))

mod_glm <- glm(DEP_DEL15 ~ wd + hr + log_dist + taxi_out + carrier_rate,
               data = train, family = binomial)
pred_p <- predict(mod_glm, newdata = valid, type = "response")
roc_obj <- roc(valid$DEP_DEL15, pred_p)
auc_val <- auc(roc_obj)
#cat("Logistic AUC:", round(auc_val, 4), "\n")
```
We first fit a logistic regression model using the following predictors:

- `wd`: day of the week (factor),
- `hr`: scheduled departure hour,
- `log_dist`: log-transformed flight distance,
- `taxi_out`: pre-departure taxi-out time estimate,
- `carrier_rate`: historical delay rate for the operating carrier.

The dataset was filtered to exclude missing values in the outcome `DEP_DEL15`, and we split it into a 70/30 training/validation set. For unseen carriers in the validation set, we imputed `carrier_rate` with the base rate from the training data.

The model achieved an AUC of 0.6884, providing a reasonable baseline and validating the usefulness of our engineered features.

3.2 Feature Importance in Logistic Model
We visualized the model coefficients to assess feature influence.
```{r}
# Extract model coefficients and format
coef_df <- summary(mod_glm)$coefficients %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "feature") %>%
  rename(
    estimate = Estimate,
    std_error = `Std. Error`,
    z_value = `z value`,
    p_value = `Pr(>|z|)`
  ) %>%
  mutate(abs_estimate = abs(estimate)) %>%
  arrange(desc(abs_estimate))

# Plot top features by absolute value of coefficients

coef_df %>%
  filter(feature != "(Intercept)") %>%
  slice_max(abs_estimate, n = 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(feature, abs_estimate), y = abs_estimate, fill = estimate > 0)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top Logistic Regression Coefficients (Feature Importance)",
       x = "Feature",
       y = "Absolute Coefficient Value",
       fill = "Direction") +
  theme_minimal()
```
The `carrier_rate` variable was the strongest predictor, followed by weekday contrasts and departure hour. This confirms the value of including both historical performance and temporal scheduling variables in the model.

## 3.3 XGBoost Model

To improve model performance and capture non-linear interactions, we implemented a gradient boosting classifier using XGBoost. In addition to the features used in the logistic model, we added:

- `prev_arr_delay`: the arrival delay of the aircraft’s previous flight, matched by tail number and hour.

This lag-based feature captures delay propagation due to aircraft reuse. We handled missing values in `prev_arr_delay` by imputing zeros and used the median to impute missing `taxi_out` values.

We used one-hot encoding for categorical variables and trained the model using a 70/30 train-validation split. Key hyperparameters included:

- `eta = 0.05`, `max_depth = 4`
- `subsample = 0.8`, `colsample_bytree = 0.7`
- `lambda = 1.0`, `alpha = 0.5`

We used early stopping with a patience of 10 rounds to prevent overfitting. The final model achieved an AUC of 0.9683 on the validation set — a significant improvement over our logistic baseline.


```{r}
library(xgboost)
# prepare previous‐flight arrival delays
last_arr <- fl %>%
  filter(!is.na(ARR_DELAY)) %>%
  transmute(
    TAIL_NUM,
    flight_date    = as.Date(FL_DATE, format = "%m/%d/%Y"),
    hr              = CRS_DEP_TIME %/% 100,
    prev_arr_delay = ARR_DELAY
  ) %>%

  group_by(TAIL_NUM, flight_date, hr) %>%
  slice_tail(n = 1) %>%
  ungroup()

# merge into train/valid and impute
train2 <- train %>%
  left_join(last_arr, by = c("TAIL_NUM","flight_date","hr")) %>%
  mutate(
    prev_arr_delay = replace_na(prev_arr_delay, 0),
    taxi_out       = replace_na(taxi_out, median(taxi_out, na.rm = TRUE))
  )

valid2 <- valid %>%
  left_join(last_arr, by = c("TAIL_NUM","flight_date","hr")) %>%
  mutate(
    prev_arr_delay = replace_na(prev_arr_delay, 0),
    taxi_out       = replace_na(taxi_out, median(train2$taxi_out, na.rm = TRUE))
  )

# build model matrices
x_train <- model.matrix(~ wd + hr + log_dist + taxi_out + carrier_rate + prev_arr_delay - 1, data = train2)

auc_xgb  <- auc(roc(valid2$DEP_DEL15, pred_xgb))

```

## 3.4 XGBoost Feature Importance
As shown in Figure 9, the most influential feature by far was `prev_arr_delay`, contributing approximately 89% of the total gain. This confirms that delays are often propagated from earlier flights, and incorporating aircraft reuse dynamics significantly improved predictive power.

The second most important feature was taxi_out, a proxy for airport congestion and ground conditions. Other notable contributors included:

- `hr` (scheduled hour of departure), capturing time-of-day patterns,
- `carrier_rate`, reflecting historical airline performance.

Remaining predictors, including `log_dist` and `day-of-week` dummies (e.g., `wdFri`, `wdTue`), had minor influence individually but helped with overall model generalization.

These results suggest that short-term operational factors, rather than static scheduling variables, are most predictive of departure delays. Incorporating real-time or near-real-time operational history — like aircraft arrival delays — is essential for high-performing models in this domain.

# Conclusion

Our analysis demonstrates that structured feature engineering combined with gradient boosting can yield strong predictive power for identifying delayed flights. XGBoost achieved the best performance with an AUC of approximately $0.78$ on the validation set. Incorporating features such as time-of-day, previous flight delays, and historical carrier performance significantly improved accuracy. These findings could inform operational scheduling and passenger alerts.
